    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# broadcastScalarLike

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Broadcast a scalar value to an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] having the same shape and [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes] as a provided input [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor].

<section class="usage">

## Usage

To use in Observable,

```javascript
broadcastScalarLike = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-base-broadcast-scalar-like@umd/browser.js' )
```

To vendor stdlib functionality and avoid installing dependency trees for Node.js, you can use the UMD server build:

```javascript
var broadcastScalarLike = require( 'path/to/vendor/umd/ndarray-base-broadcast-scalar-like/index.js' )
```

To include the bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/ndarray-base-broadcast-scalar-like@umd/browser.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function () {
    window.broadcastScalarLike;
})();
</script>
```

#### broadcastScalarLike( x, value )

Broadcasts a scalar value to an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] having the same shape and [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes] as a provided input [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor].

```javascript
var zeros = require( '@stdlib/ndarray-base-zeros' );
var getDType = require( '@stdlib/ndarray-dtype' );

var x = zeros( 'float32', [ 2, 2 ], 'row-major' );
// returns <ndarray>[ [ 0.0, 0.0 ], [ 0.0, 0.0 ] ]

var y = broadcastScalarLike( x, 1.0 );
// returns <ndarray>[ [ 1.0, 1.0 ], [ 1.0, 1.0 ] ]

var dt = String( getDType( y ) );
// returns 'float32'
```

## Notes

-   Along with data type, shape, and order, the function infers the "class" of the returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] from the provided [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor]. For example, if provided a "base" [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor], the function returns a base [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor]. If provided a non-base [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor], the function returns a non-base [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/ctor].
-   If `value` is a number and the [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes] of the input ndarray is a complex [data type][@stdlib/ndarray/dtypes], the function returns an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] containing a complex number whose real component equals the provided scalar `value` and whose imaginary component is zero.
-   The returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] is a view on an [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] data buffer containing a single element. The view is **not** contiguous. As more than one element of a returned view may refer to the same memory location, writing to the view may affect multiple elements. If you need to write to the returned [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor], copy the [ndarray][@stdlib/ndarray/base/ctor] **before** performing operations which may mutate elements.
